Week5 : Day 9
=============
ðŸ“Œ Alerts/Dialogs
=> we have to handle alert to proceed with the 
further actions on the page
=> all alerts are from the application which is written in the JS
=> We cannot inspect the alert

Types of Alerts:
1. Modal dialog ==> all these modal dialogs are not inspecable
 1.1. Simple alert ==> We have only action we can perform eg, message and 'ok' button.
 1.2. Confirm alert
   => We have a message along with action of 'Ok' and 'Cancel' 
   => We can either accept or decline it
 1.3. prompt alert
   => We have a message with textbox along with 'ok' & 'cancel' option.
   => Enter the input and accept it.
   => or we can cancel it.
 1.4. beforeUnload alert
   => a message + leave/Stay
   => Accept or dismiss the alert
2. Non-modal dialog
 2.1. sweet alert: 
  => Can be inspected
  => even if it inspected, we have to handle it to proceed with the further 
      action to perfomr in the webpage.
